# **Project: Secure Web Application Deployment with CI/CD Pipeline on Linux**

**Project Overview:**
Create a secure web application deployment system that integrates continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices on a Linux server. The project will focus on automating the deployment of web applications with security features baked into the pipeline.

**Key Objectives:**
- **Web Development:** Build a basic web application using a framework like Node.js, Django, or Flask, or use an existing open-source web app.
- **Linux & DevOps:** Deploy the app on a Linux server, setting up a CI/CD pipeline using tools like **GitLab CI**, **Jenkins**, or **GitHub Actions**.
- **Cybersecurity:** Implement security best practices during deployment, including:
  - Secure SSH access (SSH key-based authentication)
  - Automated security checks in the pipeline (using tools like **SonarQube**, **OWASP ZAP**, or **Clair** for container security)
  - SSL certificate automation with **Let's Encrypt**
  - Hardening of the Linux server with security tools (e.g., **Fail2Ban**, **UFW/iptables**, and **SELinux/AppArmor**)
  - Auditing and logging (e.g., setting up centralized logging with **ELK Stack** or **Prometheus** for monitoring)
  
**Project Flow:**
1. **Stage 1: Web Application Development**
   - Build a simple web application (e.g., a blog, portfolio, or API) with user authentication and role-based access control.
   - Use a web framework like **React.js/Next.js** for the frontend and **Node.js/Express** or **Django/Flask** for the backend.
   
2. **Stage 2: CI/CD Setup**
   - Set up a GitHub or GitLab repository.
   - Implement a CI/CD pipeline to automate the following steps:
     - Pull code from version control (GitHub/GitLab).
     - Run security testing and static analysis.
     - Build and deploy the app using Docker.
     - Set up an automated deployment to the Linux server (could be a VPS like your **Hostinger VPS**).

3. **Stage 3: Linux Server Configuration**
   - Configure your Linux server for hosting the web app.
   - Automate the server setup with **Ansible** or **Terraform** (infrastructure as code).
   - Implement proper logging and monitoring with **ELK Stack** or **Prometheus**.
   
4. **Stage 4: Cybersecurity Enhancements**
   - Use **OWASP ZAP** in the CI pipeline to scan for vulnerabilities in the web application.
   - Configure **Fail2Ban** and **UFW/iptables** to secure SSH and web access.
   - Enforce SSL/TLS encryption with **Let's Encrypt** for HTTPS.
   - Ensure all the components of the system are hardened and monitored.
   
5. **Stage 5: Testing & Maintenance**
   - Test the security of the app regularly using tools like **Metasploit** or **Nmap**.
   - Simulate attacks like **DDoS**, **SQL Injection**, and **Cross-site scripting (XSS)**, and verify if the system holds up.
   - Regularly update the Linux server and application for patches and new vulnerabilities.

**Outcome:**
By the end of this project, youâ€™ll have a fully automated, secure web application deployment system running on Linux, following DevOps principles and focusing on cybersecurity. The app will have robust security measures, a continuous deployment pipeline, and monitoring, making it production-ready.

This project will demonstrate expertise across multiple domains: Linux server management, CI/CD, web application development, and cybersecurity practices.
